			<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In this project we are mainly
				focus on three modules such as Admin, College and Student in which
				admin handle the whole scenarios like admin can give access to
				college and student and can also delete them if he feels that they
				are unauthorized members of this system. College which can handle

				student and faculty details and also update their profile, students
				have any query related to study materials so they can request to
				college to provide specific materials with proper documentation.
				Generally, an existing system the educational institutions provide
				online material which is one-way uploading and hence the database is
				limited to a single person and hence the information updating needs
				time, But in this project, the database was made online so the
				database was accessible to multiple users. This system provides
				student to easily navigate through the application for more

				information in a most secure manner and easy access to their
				particular account so that student can access their study materials
				as per their convenience.</p>

			<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online learning is a term
				used to describe distance or correspondence courses that are offered
				over the Internet. The courses offered through online learning cover
				a wide range of subjects, audiences, and prices. This educational
				method is growing in popularity as a cost-effective method of
				providing access to education for a large population.</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are five main reasons
				behind the growth in online learning: access, efficiency, stability,
				cost, and technology. The explosion in online learning tools and the
				adoption of this method by both post-secondary educational
				institutions and high schools around the world speaks to the
				fundamental desire for more education. The expanded access to
				knowledge and information provides the groundwork necessary for many
				people to start new careers and gain new skills.</p>

				facilities to send response to appropriate requests so it makes it
				makes the environment with two way communication as student has any
